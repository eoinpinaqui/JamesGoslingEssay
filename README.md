# James Gosling - Dr. Java

### Introduction and Background
Over the summer, I worked as a Software Development Engineering Intern at Amazon Web Services (AWS) for five months. My team often collaborated with other teams across the globe, rushing to complete features to be announced at AWS re:Invent this year. James Gosling led one of these teams. Every engineer that I encountered at AWS revered Gosling as an extremely talented computer scientist, capable of solving problems or enormous complexity. It was not until I looked into Goslings past accomplishments that I realised how justified this admiration was.  

Gosling was born on the 19th of May 1955 in Alberta, Canada. After receiving a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Calgary, he went on to continue his studies at Carnegie Mellon University as a graduate student. While working on his doctorate, he built a multi-processor version of Unix for a 16-way computer system and developed various compilers and mail systems. Goslings dissertation, entitled “The Algebraic Manipulation of Constraints”, focussed on the problem of performing constraint satisfaction in an interactive graphical layout system.

### Gosling Emacs
Gosling’s first major contribution to the world of software engineering came in 1981 when he created Gosling Emacs. Gosling Emacs, or "Gosmacs", is a discontinued Emacs implementation written in C. Initially, Gosling permitted the free distribution of "Gosmacs", as was required by the "Emacs Commune" in the 1980s. Engineers admired "Gosmacs" for its unique display code that used a sophisticated dynamic programming technique that solved the classical string-to-string correction problem. This algorithm was so complex that it was headed by a skull-and-crossbones in ASCII art to warn other engineers that even if they thought they understood how it worked, they probably did not. For a while, "Gosmacs" was the de facto Unix Emacs editor.  

Richard Stallman used some of the "Gosmacs" code in the development of the initial version of GNU Emacs, rewriting some of the display code headed by skull-and-crossbones to make it "…shorter, faster, clearer and more flexible". Gosling later sold "Gosmacs" to UniPress, who then asked Stallman to stop distributing his version of Emacs for Unix. Following this, Richard Stallman removed all the "Gosmacs" code entirely from GNU Emacs by version 16.56.  These disputed inspired Stallman to create the first formal license for Emacs, as Congress had introduced copyright for software in 1980.  

### The Impact of Gosling Emacs
In 1989, Richard Stallman wrote the GNU General Public License (GPL) to produce one license that could be used for any project. The original was based on a unification of similar licenses for early versions of the GNU Debugger, the GNU C Compiler and the GNU Emacs. While we cannot credit Gosling with the creation of the GPL, we can recognise the role that "Gosmacs" played in the early stage of the license. The relationship between the GNU Emacs License and "Gosmacs" is clear, as Stallman created the GNU Emacs License following the aforementioned disputes from UniPass.  

The three licenses listed above contained similar provisions to the modern GPL but were specific to each program. This made the licenses incompatible, despite being basically the same license. Historically, the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain. Examples of prominent free software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). It is salient that Gosling made an impact on the GPL, as "Gosmacs" is the reason for one of the original licenses that the GPL is based on. 

### The Java Programming Language
Without a doubt, Goslings greatest contribution to software engineering and computer science is the creation of the Java programming language. Java was originally developed by Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems’ Java platform. Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere", meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java syntax is like C and C++ but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.
  
Originally, Java was designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time. Initially, the language was called Oak, after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling’s office. There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java programming language:
1. It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.
2. It must be robust and secure.
3. It must be architecture-neutral and portable.
4. It must be executable with high performance.
5. It must be interpreted, threaded and dynamic.  
  
Java quickly became one of the most popular programming languages after Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996 and most major web browsers incorporated the ability to run Java applets within web pages. Today, Java runs on everything from laptops and games consoles to scientific computers.

### The Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
Portability is a vital component of the Java design, meaning that programs written for the Java platform must run similarly on any combination of hardware and operating system with adequate run-time support. Gosling achieved this by designing the platform so that Java language code is compiled to an intermediate representation called Java bytecode, instead of directly to architecture-specific machine code. Java bytecode instructions are analogous to machine code, but they are intended to be executed by a virtual machine written specifically for the host hardware. End users use a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on their machine for standalone Java applications, or in a web browser for Java applets.
  
This clever use of universal bytecode makes porting simple. However, the overhead of interpreting bytecode into machine instructions makes interpreted programs almost always run more slowly than native executables. On November 13th 2006, Sun released much of its JVM as free and open-source software, under the terms of the GNU GPL. On May 8th 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of its JVM’s core code available under free software/open-source distribution terms, aside from a small portion of code to which Sun did not hold the copyright.  

### The Impact of Java
Java is at the core of our digital life. It powers many tools which we use in our everyday lives and has influenced the IT industry in a huge way. For instance, Twitter manages over 400 million tweets per day through a reliable infrastructure powered by Java. Netflix handles 2 billion content requests per day with seamless connectivity through Java-based support. Hence, over 12 million developers trust Java for their various assignments and industrial projects, making Java the most used programming language worldwide. These trends are results of Java’s constant effort to upgrade its core libraries to include elements needed for the latest technological challenges. Java has seen constant evolution in terms of its rich set of APIs, frameworks, libraries, IDEs and development tools. Java has an expansive collection of libraries that supports new-age technologies like:  
- Cloud Computing  
- Big Data  
- Internet of Things  
- Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence  
- Gaming and Animations

Here are some examples of impressive projects that use Java:
- The Java language is a key pillar in Android, an open-source mobile operating system. Although Android, built on the Linux kernel, is written largely in C, the Android SDK uses the Java language as the basis for Android applications but does not use any of its standard GUI, SE, ME or other established Java standards. The bytecode language supported by the Android SDK is incompatible with Java bytecode and runs on its own virtual machine, optimized for low-memory devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. 
- Minecraft was originally created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several early test versions, it was released as a paid public alpha for personal computers in 2009 before officially releasing in November 2011, with Jens Bergensten taking over development. Minecraft has since been ported to several other platforms and is the best-selling video game of all time, with 200 million copies sold and 126 million monthly active users as of 2020. 
- NASA World Wind is an open-source proprietary software. The program is written in Java and runs on all operating systems the OpenGL stack is implemented for. Initially, the program contains low-resolution maps. When zooming in some areas on the map, high-resolution images are downloaded from NASA servers. The program allows you to select the scale, direction and viewing angle, visible layers, as well as to search by geographical names. The application also has the ability to display the names of geographical objects and political boundaries. NASA World Wind has an extensible architecture. There are GPS plugins for displaying clouds, earthquakes, hurricanes in near real-time, and a number of others.
